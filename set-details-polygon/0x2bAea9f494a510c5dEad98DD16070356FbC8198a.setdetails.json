    "setDescription": "The Supercash Active Fund (SCASH) is a medium-term focused DeFi fund that exposes investors to the market on uptrends and protects on downtrends. It uses a trading/signaling strategy to buy or sell assets according to an optimized trend following algorithm, which tries to keep the fund allocated on a set of cryptoassets (e.g. ETH, BNB, BTC, etc.) during all the uptrend, otherwise reallocating the fund to dollar (e.g. USDC) to protect it during downtrends.",
